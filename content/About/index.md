**Thanks for checking out my site!**



I am an ambitious data science professional well-versed in working with large datasets, breaking down information and communicating results clearly. I'm a practiced statistical programmer with experience using geospatial tools. I am an adaptable and driven individual with a strong work ethic and the ability to thrive in team-based or individually motivated settings.

I just recently defended my Master's thesis at the university of Ottawa in the Kharouba lab. If you are interested in seeing the currently private repository for my thesis, please let me know!
