### After two years of contemplating, I finally decided to try building a website.
Gaining inspiration from the https://plantarum.ca/ website of my thesis co-supervisor, I decided to look into creating a static site with Hugo. I plan for this site to serve as a general directory for my contact information, CV, and newsfeed regarding what I have been up to!

I also hope to update this site with progress on my research over the course of the next year. Ideally, this will be the next stop for interested parties after they have heard about or seen my work. With that in mind, I plan to host the overall results of my thesis alongside some more in-depth details surrounding my analysis in the near future.

Thank you once again for stopping by!
