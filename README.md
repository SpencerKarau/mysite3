For now if we want to add more posts with images, follow these steps

open gitbash
navigate to site3
create a new post using: hugo new content posts/name-of-folder-you-want/index.md
go into the content folder via github explorer and find the folder you just created
edit the index.md file as you see fit
if you want to add images, create a images folder and put them in their. Then reference them. Look at joint-lab-pres or my-first-article for examples.


don't forget to remove the line about draft = true (or change it to false)
