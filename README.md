# Mysite

For now if we want to add more posts with images, follow these steps

open gitbash
navigate to site3
create a new post using: hugo new content posts/my-first-post.md
go into the content folder via explorer and under posts create a new folder with the name of the post you want (i.e. New Data)
move the created markdown file into the newly created folder and change its name to index.md
add an images folder to the previously created folder

reference the my-first-article folder for example


don't forget to remove the line about draft = true (or change it to false)

I will figure out how to add images later
