      <description>First article published as of 2023-08-22. This article stemmed from work completed during the first semester of my degree! Thank you to everyone who made this work possible. The paper is titled &amp;ldquo;On the effectiveness of public awareness campaigns for the management of invasive species&amp;rdquo; and was published in environmental conservation.
Abstract: Invasive species can have disastrous effects on the ecosystems they invade, requiring costly, labour-intensive mitigation. Public awareness campaigns are often used as a tool to reduce these speciesâ€™ impacts.</description>

      <description>After two years of contemplating, I finally decided to try building a website. Gaining inspiration from the https://plantarum.ca/ website of my thesis co-supervisor, I decided to look into creating a static site with Hugo. I plan for this site to serve as a general directory for my contact information, CV, and newsfeed regarding what I have been up to!
I also hope to update this site with progress on my research over the course of the next year.</description>
